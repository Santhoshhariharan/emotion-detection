### Emotion Detection Using Real-Time Camera Streaming

---

#### Overview:
This project aims to detect emotions in real-time using camera streaming. Emotion detection is a crucial task in various fields including human-computer interaction, market research, and psychology. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, usage, and additional resources.

---

#### Features:
- Real-time emotion detection using live camera feed.
- Supports multiple emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.
- Graphical representation of detected emotions over time.
- Adjustable sensitivity and accuracy parameters.

---

#### Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/emotion-detection.git
   cd emotion-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pre-trained Models:**
   Download the pre-trained models required for emotion detection. Update the configuration file (`config.json`) with the paths to these models.

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

---

#### Usage:

1. **Start the Application:**
   Run the application using the command specified in the setup instructions.

2. **Camera Selection:**
   If you have multiple cameras, the application will prompt you to select the appropriate camera.

3. **Real-Time Emotion Detection:**
   Once the camera feed is established, the application will start detecting emotions in real-time.

4. **Visualization:**
   Emotions detected are displayed on-screen in real-time, along with a graphical representation (optional feature).

5. **Adjust Settings:**
   Modify parameters such as sensitivity or accuracy thresholds in `config.json` to fine-tune the detection process.

#### Additional Notes:

- **Performance:** The performance of emotion detection may vary depending on lighting conditions and camera quality.
- **Customization:** Developers can extend this project by integrating it with other applications or by modifying the source code to add new features.
